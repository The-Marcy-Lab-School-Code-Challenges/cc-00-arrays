## example.js

The function `getAverage` takes an array of numbers as input.

- It uses a **for loop** to add up all the numbers in the array.
- Then it divides the total by the array’s length to find the **average**.
- Finally, it returns that average value.

```jsx
getAverage([2, 4, 6, 8]); // Output: 5
getAverage([1, 2, 3]);    // Output: 2
```

## index.js

Write a `findMax` function that takes an **array of numbers** as input and returns the **largest number** in that array.

```jsx
findMax([3, 7, 2, 9, 5]); // ➜ 9
findMax([-1, -5, -3]);    // ➜ -1
```
